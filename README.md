Code for magdata for Bob.  This contains an example using the 00 and 10 vertical at ANMO. 
rdmseed.m reads the mseed data and example.m does a small scale difference and makes a plot.
I have included example data in the program.

spectralratio.m
=======
This is similar to example.m but does a spectral ratio between the two data streams


example.m
=======
This program just reads in some mseed data and plots the data.  It also calculates a few differences


exampleTemp.m
=======
This program fits a cosine function to some temperature data the results and setup are similar to example.m

To Do
=======
Need to comment the code better and eventually add it to one of the main repositories.
